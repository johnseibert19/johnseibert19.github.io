I am a senior at Commonwealth University - Bloomsburg in the Eileen G. Jones Honors College, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. I am currently applying to PhD programs for the Fall 2026 academic year.

My academic focus lies at the intersection of pure mathematics and computational application. Currently, I am completing my honors thesis under the advisement of Dr. John Polhill, researching Partial Difference Sets (PDS) and their implications in combinatorial design theory.

Beyond pure mathematics, I have extensive experience in applied research and software engineering. My background includes:
* **NSF REU at UC Riverside (2025):** Investigating transcriptomics in Alzheimer's disease using machine learning models.
* **Geisinger Health System:** Contributing to genomic research on sex chromosome aneuploidies, which resulted in a co-authored publication in *Nature Communications*.
* **Systems & Application Development:** Building a custom shell in C and developing "QuizGPT," an Android application integrating the Gemini AI model and Firebase for semantic grading.
