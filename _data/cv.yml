      institution: University of California, Riverside
      year: June 2025 - August 2025
      description:
        - Developed and trained 3 machine learning models to predict biological age from high-dimensional bulk RNA-seq data.
        - Engineered a data preprocessing pipeline to clean, log-transform, and z-score standardize gene expression data from GTEx v8 and GSE125583.
        - Implemented feature selection using linear modeling and Benjamini-Hochberg correction to identify 400 significant age-responsive genes.
        - Validated hypothesis that AD patients exhibit accelerated biological aging.

      year: May 2023 - August 2023
      description:
        - Implemented a recursively-defined function (Mahler-Popken complexity) to define the cost of an integer using Python.
        - Conjectured the function and 6 primitive recursive functions are computable.
